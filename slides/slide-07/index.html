          AI can imitate patterns, but it cannot embody lived experience,

                Unlike humans, AI models lack sensory perception and lived experiences. Consequently, they cannot truly evaluate whether a generated image conveys the intended emotion or 'feels right.' The assessment of authenticity, artistic intent, and emotional resonance remains an exclusively human capacity.

                Creative briefs frequently draw upon deeply personal and collective lived experiences—such as cultural heritage, musical influences, or community narratives—elements that AI datasets cannot inherently intuit. It is the human artist who provides the essential narrative arc, imbuing the artwork with meaning and context that transcends mere aesthetic generation.

                While AI can generate surprising combinations, it is the artist who possesses the critical discernment to identify which unexpected outputs are truly valuable and how to further develop them. Human creativity involves intentional curation, meticulous editing, and the deliberate act of breaking rules to achieve novel and impactful artistic expressions.

                In reinforcement learning, engineers continually contend with the fundamental trade-offs between function approximation, bootstrapping, and off-policy data. These elements collectively form what is often termed the 'Deadly Triad,' posing significant challenges to model stability during training. In contrast, humans possess an innate ability to learn and adapt without succumbing to such instability.

                A 2025 report by Fastcode underscores a critical limitation of Large Language Models: they primarily reiterate and remix existing human-documented information. This fundamental characteristic implies that AI cannot genuinely replace human engineers or artists, as it lacks firsthand contextual understanding, intrinsic motivation, and the capacity for truly novel creation independent of its training data.
